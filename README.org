* Files to setup the training labs for Kea DHCP and IPv6 training

This repository contains scripts to build the training lab environment
on Linux using Linux container for the [[https://kea.isc.org][Kea DHCP Server]] and IPv6 training.

The training lab scripts have been tested on the latest Fedora Linux
version (Fedora 36+). They might also work with the latest Red Hat EL
9.x and Rocky/Alma Linux.

The Kea Lab environment depends on podman https://podman.io. Podman
can possibly substituded by Docker (https://docker.io), however it has
not been tested.

* Building

Make sure you have =podman= installed.

The script =build= in the =installation= directory will build all the
container images reqired.

The directory =bin= should be in the executable search path:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/repo/bin
#+END_EXAMPLE

Every Lab has a couple of scripts:

** run

The =run= script will remove previous instances of the containers and
start a fresh version of the containers. Currently the script will
issue a couple of error messages if the containers to be cleaned are
not available, this will be fixed in future versions.

** stop

The =stop= script will stop the lab containers

** clean

The =clean= script will remove the lab containers for this lab

** Configuration

The directory =conf= will contain the persistent configuration for Kea
DHCP and BIND 9. The directory =conf2= will contain the persitent
configuration files for the 2nd ISC Kea DHCP Server for the HA lab in
lab05.

The directory =conf.template= contain example configuration files for
the different labs.
